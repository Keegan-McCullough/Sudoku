<h1>How To Play Sudoku</h1>
<p>Your goal is to fill the board with numbers 1-9, however, you cannot
    have the same number appear twice in the same row, column, or subgrid.</p>
<p>The game gives you a half full board of numbers, these numbers cannot be
    changed, and you will have to work around them, they are in the white spaces.</p>
<p>You can use the keyboard display to type your number or you can
    use the actual keyboard. You can click on the square that you want to
    place a number it will be gray to indicate which square will receive an input.</p>

<h2>Advanced Controls </h2>
<p>If the move is invalid the squares of the same
    input number will turn red to help you know what to change.</p>
<p>The number will not be placed and if you click a square the red will
    go away or if you put a valid number in, a invalid number will
    never be placed so make sure to change one of the reds if you want
    it in that square.</p>
<p>You can hit backspace on the keyboard or clear on the number pad
    to remove a number from the selected square. Reminder that whatever
    square was last clicked will take the input so make sure to click the
    square you want to change.</p>
<p>The help icon in the corner will allow you to quit the puzzle or restart
    with a new board.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
